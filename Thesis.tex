\begin{chapterabstract}
This chapter gives a basic introduction to LATEX. For more, visit \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes}
\end{chapterabstract}


LATEX (pronounced LAY-tek or LAH-tek) is a tool used to create professional-looking documents. It is based on the WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) idea, meaning you only have focus on the contents of your document and the computer will take care of the formatting. Instead of spacing out text on a page to control formatting, as with Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, users can enter plain text and let LATEX take care of the rest.

LATEX is used all over the world for scientific documents, books, as well as many other forms of publishing. Not only can it create beautifully typeset documents, but it allows users to very quickly tackle the more complicated parts of typesetting, such as inputting mathematics, creating tables of contents, referencing and creating bibliographies, and having a consistent layout across all sections. Due to the huge number of open source packages available (more on this later), the possibilities with LATEX are endless. These packages allow users to do even more with LATEX, such as add footnotes, draw schematics, create tables etc.

One of the most important reasons people use LATEX is that it separates the content of the document from the style. This means that once you have written the content of your document, we can change its appearance with ease. Similarly, you can create one style of document which can be used to standardise the appearance of many different documents. This allows scientific journals to create templates for submissions. These templates have a pre-made layout meaning that only the content needs to be added. In fact there are hundreds of templates available for everything from CVs to slideshows.

\chapter{Title of the chapter}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\epigraph{If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.}{Isaac Newton}
\begin{chapterabstract}
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
\end{chapterabstract}
% The following text is taken from wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#/media/File:Stylised_atom_with_three_Bohr_model_orbits_and_stylised_nucleus.png

Physics is the natural science that studies matter \citep{Poisson:2009pwt} its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.

This is how you cite \citep{Abbott:2016blz}.  

To write a equation do the following:

\begin{equation}
\{ u_t(x,t)=u_{xx}(x,t)\}, \text{ where $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ and $t>0$}
\label{eq:heat_equation}
\end{equation}

This is how you cite a equation \ref{eq:heat_equation}, chapter \ref{Introduction_Chapter} or a figure \ref{fig:Bohr_Model}.
